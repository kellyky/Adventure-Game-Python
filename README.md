# Adventure-Game-Python
Text adventure is a text-based game where you'll encounter and have to defeat dangerous oceanographers and evil but inept pirates.

Adventure-Game-Python is played in the terminal. It's a simple choose-your-own-adventure game. As the narrator tells the story, you'll have choices to make. The outcome depends on your choices! Will you defeat the inept pirates? Will you play again?
